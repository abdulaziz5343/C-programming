/* Modify Programming Project 5 from Chapter 7 so that the SCRABBLE values of
 * the letters are stored in an array. The array will have 26 elements,
 * correspinding to the 26 letters of the alphabet. For example, element 0 of
 * the array will store 3 (because the SCRABBLE value of the letter A is 1),
 * and so forth. As each character of the input word is read, the program will
 * use the array to determine the SCRABBLE value of that character. Use an
 * array initializer to set up the array.
