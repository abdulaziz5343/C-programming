 /* Write a program that reverses words in a sentence:
 *
 * Enter a sentence: you can cage a swallow can't you?
 * Reversal of sentence: you can't swallow a cage can you?
 *
 * Hint: Use a loop to read the characters one by one and store them in
 * a one-dimensional char array. Have the loop stop at a period, question mark,
 * or exclamation point (the "terminating character"), which is saved in
 * a separate char variable. Then use a second loop to search backward through
 * the array for the beginning of the last word. Print the last word, then
 * search backward for the next-to-last word. Repeat until the beginning of the
 * array is reached. Finally, print the terminating character.
