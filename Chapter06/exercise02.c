/* Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, then calculates
 * and displays their greatest common divisor (DCD):
 *
 * Enter two integers: 12 28
 * Greatest common divisor: 4
 *
 * Hint: The classic algorithm for computing the GCD, known as Euclid's
 * algorithm, goes as follows: Let m and n be variables containing the two
 * numbers. If n is 0, then stop: m contains the GCD. Otherwise, compute the
 * remainder when m is divided by n. Copy n into m and copy the remainder into
 * n. Then repeat the process, starting with testing whether n is 0.
