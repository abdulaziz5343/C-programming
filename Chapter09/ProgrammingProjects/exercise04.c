/* Modify Programming Project 16 from Chapter 8 so that it includes the following functions:
 *
 * void read_word(int counts[26]);
 * bool equal_array(int counts1[26], int counts2[26]);
 *
 * main will read_word twice, once for each of the two words entered by the
 * user. As it reads a word, read_word will use the letters in the word to
 * update the counts array, as described in the original project. (main will
 * declare two arrays, one for each word. These arrays are used to track how
 * many times each letter occurs in the words.) main will then call equal_array,
 * passing it the two arrays, equal_array will return true if the elements in
 * the two arrays are identical (including that the words are anagrams) and
 * false otherwise.
