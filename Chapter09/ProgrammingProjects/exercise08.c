/* Write a program that simulates the game of craps, which is played with two
 * dice. On the first roll, the player wins if the sum of the dice is 7 or 11.
 * The player loses if the sum is 2, 3, or 12. Any other roll is called the
 * "point" and the game continues. On each subsequent roll, the player wins if
 * he or she rolls the point again. The player loses by rolling 7. Any other
 * roll is ignored and the game continues. At the end of each game, the program
 * will ask the user whether or not to play again. When the user enters
 * a response other than y or Y, the program will display the number of wins and
 * losses then terminate.
 *
 * You rolled: 8
 * Your point is 8
 * You rolled: 3
 * You rolled: 10
 * You rolled: 8
 * You win!
 *
 * Play again? y
 *
 * You rolled: 6
 * Your point is 6
 * You rolled: 5
 * You rolled: 12
 * You rolled: 3
 * You rolled: 7
 * You lose!
 *
 * Play again? y
 *
 * You rolled: 11
 * You win!
 *
 * Play again? n
 *
 * Wins: 2  Losses: 1
 *
 * Write your program as three functions: main, roll_dice, and play_game. Here
 * are the prototypes for the latter two functions:
 *
 * int roll_dice(void);
 * bool play_game(void);
 *
 * roll_dice should generate two random numbers, each between 1 and 6, and
 * return their sum. play_game should play one craps game (calling roll_dice to
 * determine the outcome of each dice roll); it will return true if the player
 * wins and false if the player loses. play_game is also responsible for
 * displaying messages showing the results of the player's dice rolls. main will
 * call play_game repeatedly, keeping track of the number of wins and losses and
 * displaying the "you win" and "you lose" messages. Hint: Use the rand function
 * to generate random numbers. See the deal.c program in Section 8.2 for an
 * example of how to call rand and the related srand function.
