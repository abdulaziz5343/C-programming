/* The power function of Section 9.6 can be made faster by having it calculate
 * x^n in a different way. We first notice that if n is a power of 2, then x^n
 * can be computed by squaring. For example, x^4 is the square of x^2, so x^4
 * can be computed using only two multiplications instead of three. As it
 * happens, this technique can be used even when n is not a power of 2. If n is
 * even, we use the formula x^n = (x^(n/2))^2. If n is odd, then x^n
 * = x * x^(n-1). Write a recursive function that computes x^n. (The recursion
 * ends when n = 0, in which case the function returns 1.) To test your
 * function, write a program that asks the user to enter values for x and n,
 * calls power to compute x^n, and then displays the value returned by the
 * function
